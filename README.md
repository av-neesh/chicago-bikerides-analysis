# chicago-bike-sharing-analysis

In this case-study, I used Chicago [bike-ride data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) for year 2021 to evaluate ride patterns of different types of riders, determine trends and theorize the underlying causes. I was then able to develop conclusions and actions based on those findings.

I have used 4 tools to analyse the data, and documented my steps and findings:

- #### **Excel :**  [GitHub]()
- #### **MySQL & Tableau Desktop :**  [R-Pubs](https://rpubs.com/Avneesh/928547) / [GitHub](https://github.com/av-neesh/chicago-bikes-analysis/tree/main/SQL%2BTableau-analysis) / [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/avneesh.)
- #### **R Studio :**  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/avneeshsingh19/chicago-bikeshare-analysis) / [GitHub](https://github.com/av-neesh/chicago-bikes-analysis/tree/main/R-analysis)

### **THE TASK:**

We want to understand how casual users and riders with annual membership use their service differently and decude interesting and insightful patterns in their bike usage. From these insights, a new marketing strategy can be to developed to boost the bike sharing company's future success.
So we have to analyse the bike-sharing data and back our findings with **compelling data insights** and **professional data visualizations**, or answer the question:

**What could motivate the “casual” users to change to an annual subscription based on their behavior?**

### **THE CONCLUDED ACTIONS:**

The business task was to compare how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. What could help to guide the company marketing strategies using the findings above?

Based on my analysis, here are my top three recommendations:

**1. Offer weekend passes.**
The busiest days for casual users are Saturday and Sunday. I would suggest offering them weekends passes for unlimited rides for a flat fee. This option may lead local users to purchase an annual membership. It could also be perfect for visitors to explore Chicago if the offer is tied up to the CityPASS program.

**2. Offer seasonal passes.**
As mentioned above, there's a clear seasonal pattern in bike usage among all users and especially casual riders. Remember that the goal is to convert casual riders into annual members. If the winter season pass is offered at a discount, some casual users might be willing to try it at a fraction of a membership cost before deciding to become year-long subscribers.

**3. Offer discounts to businesses.**
Per Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, about 30% of Cyclistic users ride to work every day. A special program would allow businesses to reduce their carbon footprint by subsidizing the cost of annual memberships to their employees. This could provide a convenient, "green" option to get around the city. It might also motivate more casual users to cycle to work more often or all the time.

To expand on my findings, it would be helpful to have information relevant to the operational cost, annual membership, single rides and day rides. That would let the team to weigh in on different membership options and decide if they are viable.
